This self-defense device will look harmless to attackers, but should you need it, it quickly transforms from hair styler to aggressor neutralizer in a second. However, the Cold Steel Honey Comb Hairbrush is a weapon that is not ideal for preventing attacks and is close-range only." ,

The Smith and Wesson Tactical Pen can be used as both a regular pen and stylus for computer screens. Its striking tip can deliver a powerful blow, but the aluminum material used would be better suited as steel for self-defense." ,

The Cat Personal Safety Keychain is basically a set of brass knuckles in the shape of a cat’s head, with the eye holes being the grips. This one is made of plastic (they’re available in metal too) but don’t be fooled, they don’t break or even scratch easily. It also requires the ability to throw punches, but even young women without fighting skills may find this keychain helpful in warding off an attacker. If only if it were to give you some peace of mind while walking home in the dark." ,
