                        <li>Bend forward from the waist. This shifts your weight forward, making it more difficult for your attacker to pick you up. It also gives you a better angle to throw elbows from side to side to the attacker’s face.</li>
                        <li>Turn into the attacker with one of your elbows and continue counterattacking.</li>
                        <li>This should give you space to turn fully, using another move to injure the face or strike the groin. With the space these moves have created, you may be able to escape and run away.</li>
